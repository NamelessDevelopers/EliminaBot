# ELIMINA DISCORD BOT

## ![Elimina Logo](https://github.com/stoir/EliminaBot/blob/master/Logos/logoBlackEmojiSize.png "Elimina Logo") About
Elimina is a discord bot that can automatically delete messages from bots after an X number of seconds (set by an administrator) in selected (toggled on) channels. 


Elimina can also show you the most recently deleted message. It will show you the most recently deleted message, or image using the ```~snipe``` command. To use the snipe command, you must have either administrator permissions, or have a role called Sniper. We made the snipe feature like this because we believe that only the selected people should have the ability to snipe messages.

***Please keep in mind that the bot has to have access to read the channel inoroder to work.***

***All messages from Elimina are deleted after 1 minute in toggled on channels***
